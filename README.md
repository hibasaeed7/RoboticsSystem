2D Gantry Robotics System

Overview

The 2D Gantry Robotics System is a robotic framework designed for precise and automated motion control in two-dimensional space. This system can be used for applications such as automated material handling, pick-and-place operations, and CNC machining.


Features:

XY Motion Control: Enables precise movement along the X and Y axes.

Stepper Motor Control: Utilizes stepper motors for accurate positioning.

Microcontroller Integration: Controlled via a microcontroller (Arduino).

Customizable Paths: Supports pre-programmed movement patterns and real-time control.

Sensor Feedback: Can incorporate sensors for collision avoidance and position correction.
